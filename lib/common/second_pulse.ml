  Single-cycle 1 Hz pulse generator. Ported from second_pulse.sv.
  Counter width is Int.ceil_log2 clk_freq (27 bits at 100 MHz).

  (* (--) names a signal node in-place (mutation) and returns the same signal.
     The naming causes the signal to appear under that label in VCD waveforms and
     Waveform.print output.  ignore suppresses the OCaml "unused value" warning
     since (--) returns the signal for chaining but we don't need the reference here.
     Without these lines the internal counter would still exist in simulation (it is
     driven by compile above) but would appear with an auto-generated hierarchical name
     rather than the friendly "cnt" / "pulse" label. *)

  (* reg_fb commentary
     ─────────────────
     The counter above could be expressed with Signal.reg_fb instead of the Always DSL:

       let cnt = reg_fb rising_edge ~enable:vdd ~width
         ~f:(fun q -> mux2 (q ==: of_int_trunc ~width (clk_freq - 1))
                            (zero width) (q +:. 1)) in
       let pulse = reg rising_edge ~enable:vdd
         (cnt ==: of_int_trunc ~width (clk_freq - 1)) in

     reg_fb makes the feedback arc explicit: the closure maps q (current register
     output) directly to the next-cycle input, and Hardcaml wires the loop for you.
     No compile call, no Variable record, no default assignment.

     Why the Always block is kept here instead:
     • This module has *two* coupled state elements (cnt + pulse) that share the same
       conditional branch.  Expressing them in one compile block mirrors the single
       always_ff block in the original SV and keeps the intent—"on max, reset both;
       otherwise increment"—in one place rather than two separate reg/reg_fb calls.
     • The Always DSL supports priority-encoded defaults (pulse <--. 0 at the top,
       overridden inside the if_) naturally; reproducing that with reg_fb requires an
       explicit mux2 that is no cleaner.
     • reg_fb shines for single-variable feedback loops (e.g. clk_div's 2-bit counter)
       where f captures everything in one tidy closure.  The trade-off flips once you
       have interdependent registers or non-trivial branching. *)
