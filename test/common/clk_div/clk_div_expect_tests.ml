(* Expect Test Suite: Clk_div

   Golden traces of the divided clock as a waveform-shaped string, one character per
   cycle. The period, the freeze under [en] low, and the restart under [rst] are all
   things you should be able to read off the row rather than decode from a list of
   booleans.

   The first group is the divide-by-four instantiation, which is what every caller gets by
   default; the ratio sweep at the bottom prints one row per divisor so the periods can be
   compared by eye against each other, which is the form a divisor mistake is most visible
   in. See findings RTL-3 for how the ratio became an argument.
