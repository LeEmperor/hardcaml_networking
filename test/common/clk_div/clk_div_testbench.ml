(* Testbench Support: Clk_div

   Shared DUT fixture, drivers, observations, and simulation scenarios used by the unit,
   Quickcheck, and expect test suites.

   The block is a free-running counter whose MSB is the divided clock, so the whole of its
   behavior is "how many enabled cycles have elapsed since the last clear", and
   [expected_trace] below is that statement written as a fold. Everything in the two test
   files is checked against it.

   Two axes, not one. [Clk_div.create] takes [?divisor] (RTL-3), so the suite is a
   [Make_testbench] functor over the ratio in the same shape as [second_pulse]'s over
   [?clk_freq], and is instantiated at 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32. The enable schedule is the
   other axis and the sharper of the two: a free-running period measurement cannot
   distinguish a counter that occasionally drops or double-counts an enable, and the
   schedule property can, because the model tracks the count rather than the phase. The
   optional argument also means [include Dut] will not satisfy [Sim_fixture.S], so
   [create] is written out.

   Ratios are chosen to bracket the degenerate end as well as the ordinary one: 2 is the
   floor the RTL accepts, where the counter is one bit wide and the MSB *is* the counter,
   so a model that assumed a spare low bit would part company here. 4 is the value the
   ratio was hardcoded at, which keeps the phase-1 goldens readable as the same traces.

   Sampling. [dst_clk] is combinational off the counter register, so [after_edge] is the
   value the divided clock takes as a result of the cycle just driven; that is what an
   observation means here. [run_stimuli_across_edge] reports both sides so a suite can pin
   the one-cycle relationship rather than assume it.

   Clear beats enable: the register spec's clear is applied ahead of the enable term, so a
   cycle with [rst] high resets the counter even though [en] is low. That ordering is
   asserted directly in the Quickcheck suite rather than only implied by this fold. *)
