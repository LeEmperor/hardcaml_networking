(* Testbench Support: Helper_circuits

   Shared DUT fixture, drivers, observations, and simulation scenarios used by the unit,
   Quickcheck, and expect test suites.

   Net-new verification: [lib/common/helper_circuits.ml] had no tests at all, despite
   [rx_datapath], [mac_top] and the UART all depending on its edge detectors and delay
   line.

   There is no DUT to instantiate. These are plain [Signal.t -> Signal.t] functions over a
   [Reg_spec.t], not modules with [I] / [O] / [create], so the fixture below defines a
   wrapper that exposes every one of them as an output of a single one-bit-input block.
   Instantiating them together rather than one per suite is deliberate: they share the
   register spec, and [rising_edge_delayed] is by construction the composition of two of
   the others, which is only checkable if both are visible at once.

   Sampling. [before_edge], and this one is not a stylistic choice. The detectors are
   combinational in the current input and the registered previous one, so at [after_edge]
   the register has already taken this cycle's value and both detectors read zero
   unconditionally - the observation would be all false, always. [before_edge] is what the
   block drives during the cycle, which is the thing a consumer sees. [run_across_edge]
   reports both so the Quickcheck suite can pin that degeneracy rather than leave it as
   folklore.

   The clear. It is stimulus here, not just setup. [run_with_clear] applies one between
   two clear-free runs, which shows the delay line flushing; [run_scheduled] takes the
   clear line per cycle so it can land on the same cycle as an edge, which is the case
   RTL-6 is about and the case a fixed-shape driver cannot express. Every coincident-clear
   scenario is run twice, with the clear and without, because "no delayed pulse appeared"
   is a claim only the clear-free control turns into evidence.
