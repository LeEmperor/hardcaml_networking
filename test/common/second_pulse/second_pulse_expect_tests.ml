(* Expect Test Suite: Second_pulse

   Golden traces of the pulse position. The waveform row is the point: the reviewable
   claim about this block is "one cycle high, [clk_freq - 1] cycles low, forever", and a
   row of characters says that where a list of booleans does not. The bottom group is the
   floor of the domain - the row at [clk_freq = 1], where the low phase has no cycles left
   in it, and the message [create] raises below that. See findings RTL-4.
