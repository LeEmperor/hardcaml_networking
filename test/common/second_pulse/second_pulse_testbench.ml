(* Testbench Support: Second_pulse

   Shared DUT fixture, drivers, observations, and simulation scenarios used by the unit,
   Quickcheck, and expect test suites.

   [Second_pulse.create] takes [?clk_freq], defaulting to 100_000_000 - one pulse every
   hundred million cycles, which no simulation is going to reach. The suite is therefore a
   [Make_testbench] functor over the divide value and is instantiated at a handful of
   small frequencies, exactly as [tx_datapath]'s is over its ethertype; the legacy harness
   made the same substitution with a bare [clk_freq_sim = 10]. The optional argument also
   means [include Dut] will not satisfy [Sim_fixture.S], so [create] is written out.

   Frequencies are chosen to separate two things a single value would confound: the
   counter is [Int.ceil_log2 clk_freq] bits wide, so a power of two makes the terminal
   count and the counter's natural wrap coincide, and a bug that reset on the wrap rather
   than on the compare would be invisible. 4, 8 and 16 are powers of two; 3, 5 and 10 are
   not and leave unused counter values above the terminal count. 1 is the degenerate end
   of the domain, added with the RTL-4 fix: every cycle is a period there, so the pulse is
   high continuously and the "one cycle wide" shape the other five share does not apply.
   It is in [runners] rather than off to the side because that is where a width formula
   that lost its floor fails first.

   Sampling. Both [pulse] and the counter are registered, so [after_edge] is the pulse the
   cycle just driven produced. That is the convention the other register-output suites
   follow.
