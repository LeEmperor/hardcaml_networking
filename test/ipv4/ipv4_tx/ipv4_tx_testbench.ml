(* Testbench Support: Ipv4_tx

   Shared DUT fixture, AXI-Stream drivers, observations, and simulation scenarios used by
   the unit, Quickcheck, and expect test suites.

   The DUT prepends a 20-byte IPv4 header - with a correct header checksum - to whatever
   byte stream layer 4 hands down, then passes that payload through unchanged. So the
   transaction here is a whole datagram, and the oracle is
   [Hardcaml_verif.Ip_udp.Ipv4.header] followed by the payload verbatim.

   Sampling. [before_edge]. Every stream output is an [Always.Variable.wire] driven off
   the current state ([m_tvalid], [m_tlast], [tx_start], [l4_tready]) or a mux off it
   ([m_tdata]), so the byte that goes on the wire during a cycle is the one this cycle's
   outputs carry. [busy] is the one register in the snapshot and reads as the value the
   FSM held entering the cycle, which is what a downstream consumer would see.

   This is the whole reason the driver here is far shorter than the superseded
   [ipv4_tx_legacy_assertion_test.ml]. That harness sampled [Cyclesim]'s post-edge refs,
   where the accepting edge has already collapsed the FSM back to Idle: it could not see
   the final payload byte, its [m_tlast], or the [tx_start] pulse at all, and
   reconstructed all three from [busy] transitions. At [before_edge] each is observed
   directly, and [tx_start] is counted rather than inferred.

   Driving model. An ordinary AXI source: present byte [source_index], hold it valid until
   the block accepts it ([l4_tvalid &: l4_tready]), advance. [ready] and [source_valid]
   are schedules over the *global* cycle index, so a stall pattern does not re-align with
   the start of each datagram in a multi-datagram run. A datagram ends on the cycle its
   [m_tlast] byte is accepted - the block returns to Idle at that edge - which is also
   where the next datagram's drive picks up.

   Endpoints are elaboration-time constants, so the suite is a [Make_testbench] functor
   over them and [runners] carries every instantiation behind one record. [Primary] is the
   pair the legacy harness used, so its printed trace can be read against these goldens;
   [Broadcast_carry] is chosen so the header words sum past 0xFFFF and the checksum's
   end-around carry is actually exercised - under [Primary] alone a fold that dropped the
   carry would still pass.

   Zero-length L4 payloads are out of scope, as they were for the legacy harness: framing
   is layer-4 driven, so a datagram with no payload byte to carry [l4_tlast] never
   completes. [drive] rejects one outright rather than timing out.

   Coverage (carried over from the legacy harness, plus the additions marked NEW):
   - nominal + short + large payloads, both UDP (17) and TCP (6) protocols
   - 1-byte payload: minimal framing, tlast lands on payload byte 0
   - backpressure: periodic mac_tready bubbles, including an aggressive pattern that
     stalls across header bytes and the tlast cycle
   - tx_start fires exactly once per datagram
   - back-to-back datagrams through one FSM instance (re-arm after completion)
   - NEW source-side bubbles: l4_tvalid deasserted mid-payload must produce an idle output
     beat, not a repeated byte
   - NEW two endpoint configurations, one of them checksum-carry-forcing
   - NEW [en] pause/resume mid-datagram, with no handshake or event escaping while low
     (findings RTL-7)
