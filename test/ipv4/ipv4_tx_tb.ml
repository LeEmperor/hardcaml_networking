  Testbench: IPv4 (L3) TX header generator (Ipv4_tx)

  Feeds a synthetic layer-4 byte stream into Ipv4_tx and checks that it prepends
  the correct 20-byte IPv4 header and passes the L4 payload through unchanged:

    [0..19]  IPv4 header (version/IHL, total_length, TTL/proto, checksum, src/dst IP)
    [20..]   the L4 payload, verbatim
    m_tlast  forwarded from the L4 stream's l4_tlast on the final byte

  The golden header checksum is recomputed in OCaml (one's-complement sum,
  end-around carry, complement) so an RTL checksum bug shows up as a mismatch on
  bytes [10..11]. total_length = 20 + l4_length; protocol is the runtime input.

  Observation model: Ipv4_tx's stream outputs are Mealy, and Cyclesim.cycle
  leaves the output refs POST-edge. Header bytes and payload[0..n-2] are observed
  directly; the final payload byte + tlast collapse to Idle on the accepting edge
  and are reconstructed from completion (busy 1->0). tx_start is a one-cycle Idle
  pulse, unobservable post-edge, so it is counted via busy 0->1 rising edges (it
  is set in the same Idle&start branch). See [drive] for the full rationale.

  Coverage:
    - nominal + short + large payloads, both UDP (17) and TCP (6) protocols
    - 1-byte payload: minimal framing, tlast lands on payload byte 0
    - backpressure: periodic mac_tready bubbles, including an aggressive pattern
      that stalls across header bytes and the tlast cycle
    - tx_start fires exactly once per datagram
    - back-to-back datagrams through one FSM instance (re-arm after completion)

  Not tested (by design): a 0-byte L4 payload. Framing is L4-driven — Ipv4_tx
  waits in Payload for l4_tvalid & l4_tlast to close the datagram, so a datagram
  with no payload byte to carry tlast would never complete. Every real L4
  (UDP/TCP) always supplies at least its own header bytes.

  (* Drive ONE datagram of L4 bytes [l4] (protocol [protocol]) through Ipv4_tx,
     assuming the FSM is currently Idle, and collect the emitted stream.

     Observation model (verified against RTL with a phase-trace): [Cyclesim.cycle]
     leaves the output refs in their POST-edge values. Header bytes and payload
     bytes [0 .. n-2] are observed directly on the m_tdata/m_tvalid handshake. The
     FINAL payload byte and its tlast are NOT observable: accepting it returns the
     FSM to Idle on the same edge, collapsing m_tvalid to 0. We detect completion
     via busy 1->0 and append the known last byte (l4[n-1]); its byte-perfect
     emission is verified end-to-end in udp_mac_top_tb.

     tx_start is likewise a one-cycle Mealy pulse in Idle and is unobservable
     post-edge; it is asserted in the SAME Idle&start branch that sets busy, so we
     count busy 0->1 rising edges as the tx_start pulse count (must be exactly 1).

     [stall_every]=k inserts a mac_tready=0 bubble every k cycles to exercise
     backpressure; 0 disables stalling.
