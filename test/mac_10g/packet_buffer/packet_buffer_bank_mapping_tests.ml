   WHAT IS BEING VERIFIED, AND WHY IT IS THE LOAD-BEARING PROPERTY

   The buffer presents one logical byte ring, [0, depth_bytes), addressed by
   [address_width] bits. The ring is a convention, not a structure: the RAMs are flat
   arrays, and the "circular" behaviour comes entirely from the pointer registers being
   fixed-width and wrapping by modular overflow. That is why [depth_bytes] is forced to a
   power of two -- the wrap has to land back on byte 0, with no comparator anywhere.

   That single address space is striped across eight banks:

     bank = addr[2:0]                  (which RAM)
     row  = addr[address_width-1:3]    (where in that RAM)

     logical byte:  ... 254  255 | 256  257  258  259  260  261  262  263 | 264 ...
     bank:               6    7  |   0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7 |   0
     row (depth 8192):  31   31  |  32   32   32   32   32   32   32   32 |  33

   One 64-bit AXI beat offers eight lanes, of which only the [write_keep_i] lanes carry
   real bytes. Storage is *packed*: no hole is left for a dropped lane. So lane L's
   address is not [speculative_pointer + L], it is

     pointer_for_lane.(L) = speculative_pointer + popcount(write_keep_i[L-1:0])

   i.e. a common base plus an *exclusive prefix sum* of the keep mask. Those are eight
   CANDIDATE addresses. Only the popcount(keep) of them belonging to enabled lanes are
   meaningful; a masked lane's candidate aliases its nearest enabled neighbour above (or
   the first address of the next beat), and is discarded by the [write_keep_i] term in
   [lane_matches].

   THE INVARIANT. For the enabled lanes the prefix values are 0, 1, ..., k-1 where
   k = popcount(keep), so their addresses are the k consecutive integers

     p, p+1, ..., p+k-1     with k <= 8.

   Any run of at most eight consecutive integers has distinct residues mod 8, and
   bank = addr mod 8. Therefore *no two enabled lanes ever target the same bank in the
   same cycle*. Corollaries, each checked below:

     (1) k = 8 (a full mid-frame beat): the eight lanes hit all eight banks exactly once
         -- a perfect permutation, specifically a rotation by (p mod 8). Full 64-bit
         write bandwidth, every RAM busy.
     (2) k < 8: exactly k banks are enabled and 8-k sit idle. Never two lanes on one bank.
     (3) The lane -> bank map is NOT fixed. It rotates every beat by (p mod 8), because
         the pointer advances by the popcount rather than by 8. A fixed lane L -> bank L
         wiring would be simpler but could not pack: a six-byte beat would have to leave a
         two-byte hole to keep lane 0 in bank 0 next beat. The rotation is the price of
         dense packing, and [pointer_for_lane] is where it is paid -- the shared base
         supplies the rotation, the prefix sum supplies the compaction.
     (4) A beat may straddle two rows (banks at and above the rotation point take row n,
         those that wrapped below it take row n+1). Harmless: the banks are independent
         RAMs with independent address ports -- but it is exactly the case a fixed
         lane->bank wiring would get wrong.

   WHY IT MATTERS BEYOND BANDWIDTH. Read from the bank's side, the invariant is what
   makes [lane_matches] one-hot, and one-hotness is what licenses the two
   [onehot_select] gathers that build [write_data] and [write_address]. Those emit
   sresize(valid) &: value into a balanced OR tree, so if two lanes ever matched the same
   bank their bytes would be OR-ed on top of each other. (The earlier form was an
   [Array.foldi] chain of [mux2] -- a priority chain, which instead silently dropped the
   lower lane's byte. Both are wrong and neither is louder, which is the point: nothing
   in the netlist enforces one-hotness, so this test is what protects it. See the
   commentary at [Mac_10g_packet_buffer]'s per-bank gather for why the tree replaced the
   chain.) So this is not merely an efficiency argument: the crossbar's *correctness*
   rests on it. That is worth checking directly rather than only inferring it from
   end-to-end data integrity.

   COVERAGE NOTE. The sweep below is exhaustive over all eight rotations x all 255
   non-zero keep masks, including *non-contiguous* masks such as 0b1010_1010. AXI4-Stream
   forbids those (see [Mac_10g_axis.beat_has_legal_keep]: all-ones mid-frame, any
   contiguous run on last) and [Mac_10g_tx_ingress] rejects them upstream. They are swept
   anyway because [Mac_10g_axis.keep_byte_count] and the prefix sum are both true per-bit
   popcounts, so the compaction hardware is strictly more general than the contract it
   serves -- and that generality should be deliberate, not accidental. The end-to-end
   tests in [packet_buffer_unit_quickcheck_tests] only ever drive contiguous masks (see
   [Testbench.input_of_action], which builds keep as (1 lsl n) - 1), so this file is the
   only thing covering the sparse case.

   ON FORMAL VERIFICATION. This is a combinational property over a small, closed input
   space, which is exactly the shape a formal tool eats for breakfast. Two directions
   worth taking if this module is ever hardened further:

     - The property as stated here is a one-line SVA assertion on the write path, e.g.
         for all lanes a /= b with keep[a] & keep[b] & write_accepted:
           pointer_for_lane[a][2:0] != pointer_for_lane[b][2:0]
       plus, when write_accepted:
           $countones({bank_write_enable_7 .. bank_write_enable_0})
             == $countones(write_keep_i)
       Both are purely combinational, so a bounded proof at depth 0 is already a complete
       proof -- no induction needed. Crucially they would hold for *every* [depth_bytes],
       whereas this file can only exercise the single elaboration it instantiates.
       Emitting them alongside the generated Verilog and running SymbiYosys / JasperGold
       would close that parameterisation gap, which simulation fundamentally cannot.
     - The deeper transactional properties (rollback never exposes speculative bytes;
       committed bytes read back in order; [bytes_used] is always the true occupancy) are
       unbounded safety statements over the pointer trio and are the natural next target.
       Those genuinely need induction, and a proof would subsume much of the
       reference-model testing in [packet_buffer_unit_quickcheck_tests].

   Exhaustive simulation here is deliberately the cheaper first step: it needs no extra
   toolchain, and it pins the reasoning above to the actual elaborated RTL rather than to
   a hand-written model of it.
