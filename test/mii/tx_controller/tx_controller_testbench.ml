(* Testbench Support: Tx_controller

   Shared DUT fixture, drivers, observations, and simulation scenarios used by the unit,
   Quickcheck, and expect test suites. This is the transmit dual of [rx_controller]'s
   suite and mirrors its [Phase] / [Compact_observation] shape.

   Net-new verification: this block had no testbench of its own and was only exercised
   indirectly through [tx_path_tb.ml].

   Sampling point. Unlike the receive suites, observations here come from
   [Step.O_data.before_edge], not [after_edge]. Every output is the controller's
   instruction to [tx_datapath] and [tx_byte_disassembler] *for the cycle now in
   progress*: [byte_mux_sel] is [sm.current], and [tx_datapath] muxes off it
   combinationally. So the byte emitted during a cycle is the one selected by that cycle's
   [before_edge] outputs. [after_edge] carries the *next* state, which the driver uses to
   decide the following cycle's stimulus - which is the whole reason the driver is a
   state-following loop rather than a fixed script.

   Driving model. [dis_ready] is held high throughout, so exactly one byte is emitted per
   non-Idle cycle and the emitted byte count is simply the number of such cycles.
   [fifo_empty] is driven from the driver's own payload accounting - low while real bytes
   remain, high once they are exhausted - and [payload_last] is asserted on the cycle that
   consumes the final real byte.

   Padding. A datagram shorter than the 46-byte Ethernet minimum is zero-padded: the RTL
   latches [padding] on the last real byte and emits zeros until the payload counter
   reaches index 45. So the payload phase always occupies max(length, 46) cycles, and the
   whole frame is 7 + 1 + 6 + 6 + 2 + max(length, 46) + 4 bytes.

   [crc_en] is the FCS window. It is high for exactly the bytes the FCS covers - the two
   MACs, the ethertype and the payload - and low through the preamble, the SFD and the Fcs
   state itself. [mac_top] gates [Tx_crc.data_valid] with it, so the suite is checking a
   real consumer's contract: a byte emitted with [crc_en] low is a byte the receiver's CRC
   will not see. Note that [crc_en] is not [Tx_crc.en], which [mac_top] ties to [tx_busy]:
   a low [en] there *reloads* the accumulator rather than stalling it, so driving it from
   [crc_en] would clear the CRC during the Fcs state, while its own result is being read
   out.

   Zero-length payloads. A datagram with no payload bytes reaches Payload with the FIFO
   already empty and never presents a byte carrying [payload_last], so the registered
   [padding] latch alone would leave the FSM stuck there. The RTL treats "empty on arrival
   in Payload" as padding, which makes length 0 emit 46 zero bytes exactly like any other
   sub-minimum datagram - so the byte-count oracle above already predicts it and the
   generators below start at length 0. The store-and-forward gate upstream still never
   launches an empty datagram, so this is a robustness property of the block rather than a
   path [mac_top] can reach.
