(* Testbench Support: Uart_tx

   Shared DUT fixture, drivers, observations, and simulation scenarios used by the unit,
   Quickcheck, and expect test suites.

   The oracle is a software UART receiver, not a cycle model. [Uart_receiver.decode] takes
   the symbols the fixture sampled off the line and reconstructs a byte the way a real
   receiver would - start bit, eight data bits least significant first, stop bit - so the
   headline property is a round trip: a random byte in, the same byte back out of the
   decoder. That is a stronger statement than "the line matched this waveform", because it
   is indifferent to how the transmitter chooses to time itself.

   Symbols, not samples. The block is tick-driven: it advances on [tick] and holds the
   line steady in between, so a symbol is the whole interval between two ticks, and the
   fixture records the line on *every* cycle of it rather than sampling once. A symbol
   whose line moves mid-interval is recorded as unstable and fails the decode - a real
   receiver sampling at its own phase would see a glitch there, and a single mid-bit
   sample would not.

   Sampling. [before_edge]. [uart_tx] is an [Always.Variable.wire] driven straight off the
   current state - Moore, no register between the state and the pin - so the line during a
   cycle is what this cycle's state selects. [after_edge] would report the *next* symbol's
   value and shift the whole frame by one.
