  Module: Board_scaffolding

  Shared Arty A7-100T board plumbing for the validation harnesses
  (Mac_top_validation_harness, Udp_mac_top_validation_harness). This is the
  domain-agnostic scaffolding every board bring-up top needs — per-domain reset
  synchronizers, the 25 MHz PHY reference clock, PHY hard-reset sequencing, the
  heartbeat LED, the RX-drain pulse, and clock-domain-crossing helpers — factored
  out so each harness only supplies its own stimulus FSM, the core it wraps, and
  its LED map.

  These are deliberately plain helper functions, NOT a Hardcaml sub-module: they
  build signals directly into the caller's circuit (no I/O record, no hierarchy
  boundary), so the caller keeps full control over signal-creation order and the
  emitted RTL is identical to hand-inlined plumbing. Call each helper at the
  point the equivalent inline code used to sit.

(* Per-domain reset synchronizer. btn[0] is a raw asynchronous input, so drop it
   through a 2-FF chain in the target clock domain. Async-assert (the FFs reset
   to 1 the instant [async_rst] goes high) and sync-deassert (0 shifts in, so
   reset releases 2 edges after [async_rst] releases). Gives clean per-domain
   reset recovery instead of feeding one async button into several clocks. *)

   becomes a 1-cycle pulse in [dst_spec]'s domain. A bare 2-FF level sync would
   drop or stretch a single-cycle pulse across the crossing, so convert to a
   toggle in the source domain, 2-FF it across, and edge-detect on the far side. *)
